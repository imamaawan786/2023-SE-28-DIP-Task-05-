Task 5
Task 5 Write a Python program that utilizes PIL, NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib to perform spatial domain filtering on a grayscale image. The program should:

Load and display the original image.

Apply several noise reduction and smoothing techniques including Mean Filter, Median Filter, Mode Filter, and Gaussian Filter.

Display each filtered image separately as well as in a single combined figure for comparison.

Provide an analysis explaining the effects of each filter on the image, covering aspects such as noise suppression, edge retention, blurring, and appropriate scenarios for using each filter.
